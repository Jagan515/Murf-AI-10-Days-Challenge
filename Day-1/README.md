# Day 1: Get Your Starter Voice Agent Running

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge** – a 10-day journey to build innovative voice agents using cutting-edge tools like Murf Falcon, the fastest TTS API! Today, we'll get a basic voice agent up and running, connecting backend and frontend for real-time conversations.

## 🎯 Objective
By the end of Day 1, you'll have a functional voice agent deployed locally, tested via browser, and shared on LinkedIn to kickstart your challenge journey.

## 📋 Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Set Up and Run the Starter Repo (Recommended Path)
- **Fork the Repo (Optional)**: If you haven't already, fork the official starter repository from [Murf AI's GitHub](https://github.com/murf-ai/ten-days-of-voice-agents-2025) to your own account for easy tracking.
- **Clone and Install**:
  1. Clone your fork (or the original):  
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ten-days-of-voice-agents-2025.git
     cd ten-days-of-voice-agents-2025
     ```
  2. Follow the setup instructions in the root `README.md`:
     - Install dependencies for backend (Python/uv) and frontend (Node.js/pnpm).
     - Set up environment variables (e.g., API keys for LiveKit, Murf Falcon TTS).
     - Run the backend: `uv run python src/agent.py` (or equivalent).
     - Run the frontend: `pnpm dev` (or equivalent).
- **Alternative Path**: If you prefer your own stack, build a simple voice agent from scratch using your favorite language/framework (e.g., Python with LiveKit + Murf Falcon for TTS/STT). Ensure it supports real-time audio I/O.

**Pro Tip**: Use Murf Falcon for TTS – it's lightning-fast and integrates seamlessly for natural-sounding voice responses!

### Step 2: Connect and Converse
- Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
- Join the voice room and start a brief conversation with your agent (e.g., "Hello, how are you?").
- Verify: Audio input/output works, and the agent responds coherently.

### Step 3: Record Your Session
- Use a screen recorder (e.g., QuickTime on Mac, OBS Studio, or Loom) to capture:
  - 30-60 seconds of you interacting with the agent.
  - Include the browser tab, your voice input, and the agent's response.
- Save as MP4 or GIF for easy sharing.

### Step 4: Share on LinkedIn
- **Post Your Video**: Upload the recording to LinkedIn with a captivating description like:  
  > "Day 1 of the Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge complete! 🚀 I got my starter voice agent running end-to-end using LiveKit and the blazing-fast Murf Falcon TTS API. Had a fun chat – check it out!  
  >  
  > Building voice agents over 10 days to push AI boundaries. Who's joining? #MurfAIVoiceAgentsChallenge #10DaysofAIVoiceAgents @Murf AI"
- **Key Elements to Include**:
  - Description of what you accomplished (setup, conversation, tech used).
  - Mention: "Building voice agents using the fastest TTS API - Murf Falcon."
  - Tag: Official Murf AI handle (@Murf AI).
  - Hashtags: #MurfAIVoiceAgentsChallenge #10DaysofAIVoiceAgents.
- Make it public and engaging – tag friends or the challenge community!

## ✅ Completion Checklist
- [ ] Repo cloned/forked and agent running (backend + frontend).
- [ ] Successful browser conversation (at least 1 exchange).
- [ ] Video recorded and ready.
- [ ] LinkedIn post live with all required mentions/hashtags.

## 🚀 Next Up
